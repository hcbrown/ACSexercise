Manipulating and summarizing a subset of the 2019 ACS 1-Year PUMS

(Originally created for Tech Rebalanced 2021)

Today we will be exploring how we can use microdata to answer a question that we can't answer using a Census summary data. We will be using a portion of the [CEPRdata](https://ceprdata.org/) extract of the 2019 1-Year American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Sample. To keep the file from being unwieldy, the sample has been restricted to respondents from Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.

Download the data [here](https://ceprdata.org/wp-content/acs/data/cepr_acs_2019_dmv.csv.zip).
